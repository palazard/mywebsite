                        After obtaining a general engineering degree and working for three years in advanced technologies, I studied digital marketing and web analysis to become a webmaster. However, I couldn't ignore the new possibilities that programming offered, so I gave in to temptation and started several bootcamps, spending my days learning and experimenting with coding.<br></br><br></br>
                        Being very curious, creative and perfectionist by nature, I don't stop at what I know, I'm always researching to achieve my project goals. With my background I consider myself a problem solver!!<br></br><br></br>
                        I strongly believe that life is all about balance - mind, body and soul must be healthy and in harmony to achieve our goals. My passions, such as surfing, yoga, meditation, and readingâ€¦ help me to move forward on my path and be unstoppable!
